I need to pause feature expansion and tighten the product. Before adding anything new, you must explain how the current app works, why it is slow, and what costs are involved.

PART 1 — Explain the current system (do this first)
1. How are places and activities currently generated?
   - Which APIs are being used (Google Places, AI, mock data, etc)?
   - Are places fetched live, pre-generated, or AI-generated?
   - Which actions cost money (API calls, AI calls)?
2. Why does loading places take so long?
   - Identify slow points (API latency, AI usage, unbatched calls, no caching, etc).
   - Compare current behaviour to Google Maps-style performance.
3. Confirm whether browsing places should cost money.
   - Browsing and searching must be as fast and cheap as Google Maps.
   - AI should ONLY run when explicitly requested (e.g. “Ask AI”).

Do not continue until you clearly explain the above.

PART 2 — Performance rules (non-negotiable)
- Browsing places must be near-instant.
- No AI calls during:
  - Explore
  - Search
  - Category browsing
- AI is only triggered by a user action (Ask AI button, preference filtering).
- Implement caching:
  - Cache place results by area + radius.
  - Cache place details by place_id.
  - Cache AI responses per place and per preference set.

PART 3 — Activity categories cleanup
- Move Wine next to Dine.
- Rename Wine to “Wine Farms”.
- Remove or replace:
  - “Play”
  - “Shows”
- Add:
  - “Golf”
- Clearly define what each category represents (no vague buckets).

PART 4 — Circles, Partner & Preferences logic
- Add “Add to Circle” button on place/activity profile pages.
- If a Partner account is linked:
  - Show “Add to Partner Plans” at the top of the profile page.
- Preference logic:
  - Personal preferences apply when browsing solo.
  - Partner preferences apply when browsing partner space.
  - Family preferences apply when browsing family circle.
- Circle preferences should only affect results when a circle is active.
- Default Explore must remain fast and unfiltered.

PART 5 — Maps & navigation fix
- Fix the “Open in Maps” button on iPhone.
- Confirm where navigation URLs are generated.
- Use proper deep links:
  - Apple Maps on iOS
  - Google Maps on Android / Web
- Validate coordinates before opening navigation.

PART 6 — Notebook & Memories redesign
- Rename “Parents Notebook” to “Notebook”.
- Notebook must be available for ALL places, not only favourites.
- Users must be able to:
  - Add notes to any place they’ve visited (even if disliked).
- Add “Add Memory” button directly on:
  - Place profile page
  - Notebook page
- When adding a memory from a place:
  - Auto-tag the place (no re-selection required).
- Memory place selector must allow:
  - Manual search
  - Not only nearby auto-suggestions
- Home > Memories becomes a timeline/wrap-up of all memories.
- Add “Share Memory” option:
  - Share to social platforms
  - Include photo, place name, and location tag.

PART 7 — Reviews clarity
- Clearly explain where review scores come from.
- Add:
  - Link out to source (Google, etc)
  - OR show first 5–10 reviews with a “Read more” link
- Make review sourcing transparent.

PART 8 — Navigation & Home behaviour
- Add a persistent “Home” button (circle icon) on all non-home pages.
- Home button must:
  - Return user to dashboard
  - Preserve search radius, location, and active circle
  - NOT reset state.

PART 9 — Partner & family data handling
- Partner page is good — keep it.
- Add option to store child info here IF user chooses.
- Allow users to:
  - Hide child info from partner
  - Move child info between Partner / Family Circle
- Add “Remove Partner” option with confirmation flow.
- Design for real-life scenarios (divorce, separation, privacy).

PART 10 — Final requirement
- Do NOT rebuild the app.
- Make incremental changes only.
- For every change:
  - List files touched
  - Explain why the change is needed
  - Confirm no negative impact on load speed

Start by explaining the current data generation, performance issues, and costs before making changes.
