You are helping me define a complete visual identity set for my app (FamPal – name can stay for now). The goal is to create a calm, friendly, family-first design system that feels personal, memorable, and easy to live with long term.

Design principles
- Warm, calm, personal
- Friendly but not childish
- Clean and modern, not corporate
- Reduce cognitive load, never noisy
- Designed to scale well on mobile (small sizes matter)

Core concept
Use a “Connected Circles” motif to represent people, shared experiences, and memories.
Circles = people or groups
Overlap = shared plans and memories
A central accent = the moment or experience

Colour palette
- Primary blue (calm, trust, planning)
- Light blue (openness, secondary people)
- Warm orange (shared moments, action)
- White or very light blue backgrounds
No heavy gradients. Flat first. Subtle texture optional but must work perfectly without texture.

1. Logo (primary mark)
- Three connected circles
  - Two larger outer circles (blue tones)
  - One smaller central circle (orange)
- Soft connecting arcs or implied overlap
- Rounded, symmetrical, balanced
- Flat vector style
- No outlines
- No sun or extra decorative elements
- Must work in monochrome and flat colour

2. App Icon (most important)
- Simplified version of the logo
- Three circles only
- No text
- No extra detail
- Strong legibility at 48×48 pixels
- Background: solid primary blue or white
- Central orange circle slightly forward
- Designed for iOS and Android home screens

3. Splash Screen
- Minimal, calm, welcoming
- Centered app icon
- Optional app name underneath
- Large white space
- Background: white or very light blue
- No illustrations or patterns
- Optional copy (only if needed):
  “Plan together. Remember together.”

4. Internal Icon System
- Rounded, friendly icon style
- Prefer filled icons over outlines
- Consistent size, stroke weight, and corner radius
- No mixing of icon styles
- Default colour: neutral blue/grey
- Active state: primary blue
- Highlighted action: orange (used sparingly)

Navigation and section icons
- Explore: sparkle or compass
- Saved: bookmark or heart
- Groups: two overlapping circles (echo the logo)
- Memories: photo frame or star

Category icons (consistent style)
- Dine: plate/fork
- Parks: tree
- Hikes: mountain
- Active: ball
- Play: dice or puzzle piece
- Shows: clapperboard

5. Empty state icons
- Use simplified connected circle or memory icons
- Soft, friendly, low contrast
- Support calm, reassuring empty-state copy

What NOT to do
- No cartoon characters
- No illustrated people
- No heavy shadows
- No emoji-style icons
- No random accent colours
- No visual clutter

Output expectations
- Logo
- App icon
- Splash screen visual
- Internal icon set
All assets should feel like one cohesive family and clearly belong to the same product.
