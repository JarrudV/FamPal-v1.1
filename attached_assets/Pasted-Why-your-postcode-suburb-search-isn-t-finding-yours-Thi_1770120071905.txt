Why your postcode / suburb search isn’t finding yours

This is usually one of these:

A) Your search is unintentionally “UK only”

A lot of examples default to UK formatting (SW1A etc) and some APIs default to US/UK results unless you restrict by country.

If you’re in South Africa, you want your lookup to be biased/restricted to ZA.

If you’re using Google’s Places/Geocoding APIs, you should set:

country restriction = ZA

optionally a region bias (Cape Town)

B) You’re using the wrong endpoint for “suburb/postcode”

Geocoding is best for postcode/address → lat/lng

Places Autocomplete is best for suburb / neighbourhood style searching

If your current search is trying to use the “places search” endpoint with a suburb name, it can fail or return weird matches.

3) The best UX fix: “Location fallback” that doesn’t feel like a chore

You want something that works on desktop and mobile, and doesn’t feel like admin.

My recommended approach (simple + sticky)
A) Top button: “Use my current location”

tries GPS/browser geolocation

B) Backup: “Choose an area”

Show:

Recent areas (last 3 you used)

Saved home area (one-tap)

A short preset list (e.g., “Cape Town CBD”, “Sea Point”, “Durbanville”, etc.)

C) Make the postcode/suburb field use autocomplete

So the user doesn’t have to guess formatting.

They type “Durban…” and it suggests “Durbanville, Cape Town…”

Tap result → you now have a valid lat/lng

This is the fastest way to make the app feel “always usable”.

4) “List local places or areas” — yes, here are 3 good ways

Depending on what data source you’re using:

Option 1 (Best): Use Places Autocomplete for areas

Use Google’s autocomplete with a restriction:

show neighbourhoods, suburbs, localities

return place_id + lat/lng

This gives you a real list of areas without you maintaining it.

Option 2 (Cheap fallback): IP based “approximate location”

If geolocation fails, use an IP lookup to guess the city, then show:

“We think you’re near Cape Town”

“Tap to confirm or search your area”

Not perfect, but better than dead UX.

Option 3 (Free dev-only): OpenStreetMap Nominatim

For dev and early testing, you can use OpenStreetMap geocoding to search suburbs/postcodes without worrying about Google billing while you stabilise the app.

5) What I’d do for FamPal specifically

Because your retention relies on “it just works”:

Keep auto location, but never rely on it.

Default to the last used area (sticky behaviour = people feel “this app remembers me”).

Use Autocomplete for suburbs/postcodes with a country restriction (ZA).

Add a “Set as Home area” toggle after a successful search.

That makes it feel personal without being a “habit app”.
