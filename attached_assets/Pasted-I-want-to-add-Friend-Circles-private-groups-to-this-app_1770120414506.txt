I want to add “Friend Circles” (private groups) to this app. This is a core feature for retention, but it must be implemented incrementally and simply.

High-level goal
Allow users to create small private groups (partner, family, friends) where they can:
- Share saved places
- Share notes or comments about places (optional at first)
- Plan activities together

Important constraints
- Do NOT build public social features
- Do NOT build real-time chat
- Do NOT rebuild WhatsApp or messaging
- Keep data minimal and private
- Groups are invitation-based only

Core concepts to introduce
1. Friend Circle (Group)
   - id
   - name (e.g. “Our Family”, “Date Nights”, “Braai Crew”)
   - owner (user id)
   - members (user ids + role)
   - created_at

2. Membership
   - owner
   - member
   - invited (optional for later)

3. Group content (V1)
   - shared_saved_places (references to place_id only)
   - shared_notes (short text comments tied to place_id)
   - shared_plans (place_id + date/time + optional note)

What to build now (V1)
UI
- Add a new top-level tab or section called “Groups”
- Groups list screen:
  - Show groups the user belongs to
  - Button: “Create new group”
- Create group flow:
  - Enter group name
  - Group is private by default
- Group detail screen:
  - Group name
  - Members list
  - Shared places list (empty state friendly)
  - “Add place to group” button (from existing saved places)

Inviting members (simple version)
- Use email-based invites or shareable invite link
- No notifications system yet
- Invited users must already have an account to join

Data rules
- A group never owns place data
- All places are referenced by place_id only
- Notes stored are lightweight text only
- All group content is visible only to group members

What NOT to build yet
- Real-time chat
- Notifications
- Reactions, likes, emojis
- Public groups or discovery
- Role complexity beyond owner/member

Engineering expectations
- Reuse existing auth and user model
- Clearly define new data models (Group, GroupMember, GroupPlace, GroupPlan)
- Keep database queries simple and indexed
- Provide exact file changes and schema updates
- Do not refactor unrelated code

UX guidance
- Groups should feel calm and personal, not social-media-like
- Empty states should guide users gently (“Add your first place”, “Invite your partner”)
- This feature should reduce planning friction, not add setup work

After implementation
- Ensure groups work both on desktop and mobile
- Ensure no performance impact on Explore or Saved views

Start by:
1. Proposing the data models
2. Adding the Groups tab and empty list UI
3. Implementing Create Group
4. Implementing Add Place to Group
