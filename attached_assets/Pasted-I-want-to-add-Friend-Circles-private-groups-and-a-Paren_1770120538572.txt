I want to add “Friend Circles” (private groups) and a “Parents Notebook Activities” list to this app. Implement incrementally without rewriting the app.

Friend Circles goals
Allow users to create small private groups (partner, family, friends) to share saved places and light planning.

Critical constraints and gating
1. Guest mode
   - Guest users cannot create or join circles
   - Guest users should still see a “Groups” section that showcases the feature (teaser state) with:
     - Sample circles UI (not real data)
     - Locked state messaging
     - A clear CTA button: “Log in to create up to 2 circles”
2. Logged-in users
   - Limit to a maximum of 2 circles per user
   - If user already has 2 circles, disable “Create new group” and show a friendly message explaining the limit
   - Circles are invitation-only, private by default

Do NOT build yet
- Public social features
- Real-time chat
- Notifications system
- Reactions/likes
- Complex roles beyond owner/member

Data model (propose and implement)
1. Group (Friend Circle)
   - id
   - name
   - owner_user_id
   - created_at
2. GroupMember
   - id
   - group_id
   - user_id
   - role (owner/member)
   - created_at
3. GroupPlace (shared places)
   - id
   - group_id
   - place_id (from places provider)
   - added_by_user_id
   - created_at
Optional later: GroupPlan (place_id + date/time)

Data rules
- Groups never store place details, only place_id references
- All group content is visible only to group members

UI requirements for Friend Circles
- Add a top-level “Groups” tab/section
- Guest mode Groups screen:
  - show teaser UI (fake sample circles like “Date Nights”, “Kids Weekends”)
  - show example shared places cards in a blurred/locked style
  - clear CTA to log in
- Logged-in Groups screen:
  - show user’s circles list
  - “Create circle” button (disabled when limit reached)
  - Circle detail screen:
    - group name
    - members list
    - shared places list
    - “Add place to circle” action (from existing saved places OR from place detail page)

Invites (simple V1)
- Use shareable invite link or email invite
- Keep it minimal; invited users must be logged in
- No notification system yet

Parents Notebook Activities feature
On the “Parents Notebook” page (or equivalent section for parents notes), add a list of “Activities/Attributes” that can be attached to a place and saved for personal use.

Activity list requirements
- Provide a predefined multi-select list of activities/attributes that users can toggle on/off for a place
- Store these selections per user per place (private, not public)
- Also allow optional custom activity tags (free text) but keep it simple

Default activities/attributes list (starter set)
Kids and family features:
- Jumping castle
- Outdoor play area
- Indoor play area
- Jungle gym
- Water features (splash pad)
- Pool
- Petting zoo
- Animal encounters
- Kid-friendly menu
- High chair available
- Changing facilities
- Pram friendly
- Shaded seating
- Safe parking
- Birthday party friendly

Nature and outdoors:
- Hike
- Easy walk
- Trail running
- Picnic spot
- Beach
- Dam/lake
- Farm visit

Food and drink:
- Coffee spot
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Wine tasting
- Beer tasting
- Craft gin tasting

Logistics and vibes:
- Free entry
- Paid entry
- Booking required
- Dog friendly
- Wheelchair accessible
- Quiet
- Busy/noisy

UI placement for Activities
- On place detail page, add a “Parents Notebook” section with:
  - private notes textarea
  - activities multi-select list (chips/toggles)
  - save/update button
- In saved places list, show small badges for selected activities (optional, minimal)

Implementation instructions
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Provide exact file names and code changes
- Ensure guest mode gating is consistent across UI routes and actions
- Add simple validation for group limit (max 2 circles per user) both in UI and server/database logic

Start with:
1. Data models and persistence
2. Groups tab with guest teaser state and logged-in list
3. Create group flow with 2-circle limit
4. Add place to group
5. Parents Notebook Activities section tied to place_id
